VM was written by Kyle Jones! Hail Kyle! The last release from Kyle
was 7.19. 

VM's home page up to version 7.19 on the World Wide Web is at
http://www.wonderworks.com/vm and the FAQ is still hosted there.

The later versions of VM have been maintained by the user community.
The current 'VM development team' (vm@lists.launchpad.net) consists of
of Robert Widhof-Fenk, Ulrich MÃ¼ller and Uday Reddy, but contributions
from various other users and developers have also been incorporated in
them.  See the info manual for a full list of contributors.

*******************************************************************************
VERSION INFO

The VM versions 8.2.0 and up are designed to work with:

- XEmacs version 21.2 or higher

- Gnu Emacs versions 21 or higher

They are not meant for use with any version of Emacs that does not
have MULE support.

The users of vcard's need a vcard.el package with vcard-api-version
2.0.  (A suitable version of vcard.el is included in this distribution.)

********************************************************************************
INSTALLATION

Read INSTALL and follow the instructions to compile and setup VM.

If you are new to VM, see example.vm for example configuration
settings (in a '~/.vm' file).  Read more in the VM manual on 'info'. 

*******************************************************************************
BUGS

Please report bugs in VM using the VM function
	   M-x vm-submit-bug-report
This function formats an email report including the entire state of VM
which can be used to diagnose and fix the bug.  Please include
information about how to reproduce the problem.

Please report any problems or bugs otherwise they cannot be fixed!

If you are not sure that the problem is a bug or that it could be of
general importance to other users, you are welcome to discuss it on
the USENET groups gnu.emacs.vm.bugs or gnu.emacs.vm.info!  However, it
is not always possible to diagnose problems without full information
about your VM settings.  So, filing a bug report is necessary.

*******************************************************************************
Homepage

The new homepage of VM is at http://www.nongnu.org/viewmail/ hosted by
Savannah.  The latest downloads of VM can also be found here.

The source code of VM is at http://launchpad.net/vm hosted by
Launchpad.

Eventually, we may migrate to a single site for both the facilities.  

*******************************************************************************
Wiki

The Wiki at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryViewMail is best
suited to conserve code snippets, cooking guides or feature requests.

*******************************************************************************
Code Repository

We maintain the source code using Bazaar (http://bazaar-vcs.org/).

If you want to get the latest development version of VM, or want to
contribute changes you may want to branch from the follwing launchpad
URI:

  lp:vm

which is short for the full URL:

  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~vm/vm/trunk


# create your own branch from the trunk
# the 'lp' URL's do they same job as the 'http' URL's above.
bzr get lp:vm	    # for the main trunk
(or)
bzr get lp:vm/8.2.x # for the latest version in the 8.2.x series
# get updates
bzr pull
# start hacking 
emacs vm-pgg.el
# commit your changes 
bzr commit
# Generate a bundle of your changes for merging
bzr bundle-revisions --output=xy-changes.diff
# Attach the bundle to a mail (rather than doing cut&paste) and send
# it to vm @ lists.launchpad.net with a descriptive subject.  
# Alternatively, upload it to your space on Launchpad
bzr push lp:~username/vm/branchname
# Then send a message to vm @ lists.launchpad.net requesting merge

*******************************************************************************
