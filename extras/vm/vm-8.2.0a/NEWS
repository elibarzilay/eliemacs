VM 8.2.0a (2011-02-28)

  CHANGES

   * The configuration of headers-only messages, introduced in 8.1.90a, has
     changed.  The variable `vm-load-headers-only' has been replaced by a
     new variable `vm-enable-external-messages'.  For IMAP folders, enabling
     external messages causes any messages larger than
     `vm-imap-max-message-size' to be loaded in headers-only form.  Smaller
     messages are loaded immediately.  You need to customie
     `vm-imap-max-message-size' for enabling headers-only operation.

   * If you download mail from IMAP spool files, the 8.1.x versions of
     VM had a bug which allowed the the `X-VM-IMAP-Retrieved' headers
     to grow unnecessarily.  This can slow down the saving of folders
     into which you downloaded IMAP mail.  To solve the problem, run
     the command `vm-prune-imap-retrieved-list' after installing
     version 8.2.0.  (See the info manual under "IMAP Spool Files".)

   * A set of inessential key bindings (a, b, e, i, w, L, M-l, !, <, >, *,
     %) have been removed from the standard VM key bindings.  If you would
     like to use them, add the line:
              (vm-legacy-key-bindings)
     to your vm-preferences-file (~/.vm.preferences).  To use the current
     key bindings instead, use the line
              (vm-current-key-bindings)
     Or, you might bind these keys to some other operations of your choice.

     However, `vm-edit-message' is available via a new key binding `C-c
     C-e'. 

   * The default settings of `vm-mime-deleteable-types' and
     `vm-mime-saveable-types' do not include the types listed in
     `vm-mime-external-content-types-alist'.  You might need to add them
     explicitly in your vm-preferences-file.

   * The variable name `vm-auto-displayed-mime-content-types' changed
     to `vm-mime-auto-displayed-content-types' for consistency with
     other variable names.  (The corresponding `-exceptions' variable
     changed as well.)

   * The variable name `vm-mime-attachment-infer-type-for-text-attachments'
     changed to `vm-infer-mime-types-for-text'.

   * Plain text forwarding has been extended to deal with MIME attachments.
     The command `vm-forward-message-plain' (bound to `Z') uses this method.
     (The normal `z' key forwards messages encapsulated using
     `vm-forwarding-digest-type'.)  There are also associated variables
     `vm-forwarded-headers-plain' and `vm-unforwarded-header-regexp-plain',
     which determine the headers included in the forwards.

   * The meaning of the variable `vm-included-mime-types-list' is
     changed.  It need only mention MIME type/subtype pairs that are
     not handled by default.  The types "text/plain", "text/enriched"
     and "message/rfc822" are now handled by default.

   * The attributes vector has been expanded to 16 elements for
     compatibility with Mozilla Thunderbird.  The first time a folder
     is written, this will cause extra time to be taken for "stuffing"
     the attributes.  But this is only a one-time cost.

   * New variable `vm-include-mime-attachments' allows the inclusion of
     MIME attachments in replies.  This functionality was originally
     part of vm-pine.el under the name `vm-mime-yank-attachments'.
     That functionality is now obsolete.  Replace references to
     `vm-mime-yank-attachments' in your customization by the new variable.
     
   * The command `vm-flag-message-read' (.) introduced in 8.1.93a is
     renamed to `vm-mark-message-read' for consistency of terminology.

  IMPROVEMENTS

   * New option 'internal-only for `vm-mime-honor-content-disposition',
     which means the content-disposition will be honored for only internally
     displayable types.

   * New variable `vm-mime-alternative-yank-method' controls the selection
     of MIME alternatives during yanking of messages (as well including and
     forwarding).

   * Added a variable `vm-verbosity' to control the granularity of
     informative messages displayed by VM.  Levels 5-8 are recommended, with
     8 corresponding to the current level.

   * New operations for manual control of thread indentation for
     dealing with long (and deep) message threads.  See info under
     "Threaded Summaries".

   * A number of "point-to-point" attachment operations have been
     added: 
     - `vm-dired-attach-file' and `vm-dired-do-attach-files' from
     dired buffers.
     - `vm-attach-message-to-composition' and
     `vm-reader-map-attach-to-composition' from VM folders.
     - a drag-and-drop feature that can be used in the window system.

   * New command `vm-switch-to-folder' defined to quickly return to a
     previously buried folder.  (Originally in vm-rfaddons.)

   * New custom command `vm-toggle-best-mime' in vm-rfaddons to toggle
     between 'best and 'best-internal' MIME altrenatives.  (Thanks to
     Alley Stoughton for this addition.)

   * New variable `vm-include-text-basic' can be used to enable the
     fallback method of quoting message text in replies.  It should
     be normally left with the default value of nil.

   * VM refrains from repeatedly checking for new mail once it has
     found some new mail on the spool. Set `vm-mail-check-always' to
     override this behavior.  

   * When a predefined virtual folder is quit, all the component
     folders that it depends on will also be quit automatically.

   * When an interactive virtual folder is quit, the message pointer
     in the virtual folder is transferred to the original folder.
     This facility can be used to search for particular messages by
     using virtual folders.

   * Restored the [Emacs] and [Undo] menu buttons that were removed in
     version 8.0.8.  For environments that do not support such buttons,
     drop-down menus will be used instead.  The variable
     `vm-use-menubar-buttons' can be used to use drop-down menus
     always.  (Thanks to Tim Cross for the fixes.)

   * Hooks `vm-arrived-message-hook' and `vm-arrived-messages-hook'
     made to work correctly for IMAP folders.

   * New variable `vm-thunderbird-folder-directory' and command
     `vm-visit-thunderbird-folder' allow the handling of Thunderbird
     folders without interference with VM's own folders.

   * New variable `vm-sort-subthreads' allows the internal messages of
     threads to be sorted into subthreads (the default) or via the
     normal sorting criteria.

   * Better support for message/external-body MIME type, with
     external-bodies loaded on demand.  If you have
     message/external-body as an element in
     `vm-mime-auto-displayed-content-types', you should remove it to
     access the new functionality.

   * Newly documented commands: `[' (`vm-previous-button') and `]'
     (`vm-next-button') allow navigation inside message
     presentation buffers.

   * New command: `!' (`vm-toggle-flag-message') allows you to flag a
     message as being important.  This adds a "!" mark in the Summary
     line for the message and highlights it with the high-priority face.

   * New variable: `vm-summary-visible' specifies which messages
     should remain visible in folded thread summaries.

   * New feature: vm-mime-external-content-types-alist allows
     emacs-lisp functions to be used for external viewing, e.g.,
     you can use `browse-url-of-file' to view html . 

VM 8.1.93a (2010-08-28)

  CHANGES

  ** New feature: Invoking vm-load-init-file with a prefix argument
     loads the init-file (~/.vm) without loading the preferences-file
     (~/.vm.preferences).  This is a good way to run VM with the
     default settings, much like `emacs -Q'.  We are advising all
     users to split their init-files to make use of this feature.  See
     info section on "Starting Up".

  ** New feature: vm-summary-enable-faces allows summary lists with
     faces turned on.  (This was formerly an add-on contributed by
     Robert Fenk under the name vm-summary-faces-mode. But there are
     several changes.  In particular, the face names do not end in
     "-face" following the Emacs naming conventions.)  See the info
     section on "Summaries" for more information.  If you currently
     use the u-vm-color package for colorizing the Summary buffers,
     please remove the feature, i.e., delete a line like 
      (add-hook 'vm-summary-mode-hook 'u-vm-color-summary-mode)
     from your VM initialization file.

  ** Commands renamed:
     `vm-mime-save-all-attachments' => `vm-save-all-attachments'(C-c C-s)
     `vm-mime-delete-all-attachments' => `vm-delete-all-attachments'(C-c C-d)

  IMPROVEMENTS

   * Sorting of messages extended to work with threads.  By default,
     threads are sorted by "activity", i.e., the date of their most
     recent activity.  But they can also be sorted by other sort keys.
     (The variable `vm-sort-threads-by-youngest-date' is now defunct.)

   * New feature: thread-folding in the Summary window allows message
     threads to be collapsed into single line summaries.  The
     following new variables control the behavior of thread folding.
       `vm-summary-enable-thread-folding',
       `vm-summary-show-thread-count' and
       `vm-summary-thread-folding-on-motion' 
     New commands:
       `vm-toggle-thread' (T), `vm-expand-all-threads' (E) and 
       `vm-collapse-all-threads' (C).
     See the info file for details.  Thanks to Arik Mitschang for this
     contribution. 

   * New experimental feature: `vm-enable-thread-opeartions' enables
     "thread operations", a method of invoking operations (such as
     deleting or saving) on message threads.  See the info file for
     details.  Thanks to Arik Mitschang for this contribution.

   * New variables: `vm-summary-thread-indentation-by-references'
     controls whether threads are indented by their original nesting
     level or according to the nesting level within the folder.
     `vm-summary-maximum-thread-indentation' specifies the maximum
     depth of indentation to be displayed.

   * New command: `vm-kill-thread-subtree' (K) allows a thread subtree
     to be deleted.  This amounts to the same thing as
     `vm-delete-message' invoked as a thread operation.

   * The calculation of threads improved using Jamie Zawinski's
     ideas.  Threads are correctly identified even if some of the
     messages are missing.

   * Added EasyPG storage of passwords for mail server accounts.  See
     info index under "passwords".

   * Virtual folder facility extended to work with POP and IMAP
     folders.  But, there are still some outstanding problems with it.

   * Resolved performance problems in summary generation.  It works
     quite fast now.

   * New variable: `vm-mime-parts-display-separator' allows you to
     insert a string as a separator between MIME parts.

   * New command: `vm-save-attachments' allows you to save all the
     attachments of a message under your own file names instead of the
     original file names given in the message.

   * New command: `vm-flag-message-read' (.) allows you to mark an
     unread or new message as read.

  BUG FIXES

   * Fixed various issues flagged by the Emacs 23 compiler warnings.

VM 8.1.92a (2010-07-10)

  IMPROVEMENTS

   * Headers-only mode for IMAP folders is now completed.  It operates
     by fetching messages into the Folder buffers, leading to a
     more reliable operation.  (However, there is an important
     outstanding bug.  See the file README.headers-only.)

   * New command `vm-list-imap-folders' can be used to list the
     folders on an IMAP server.

   * In headers-only mode, a limited number of messages can be fetched
     on demand for message preview.  New variable
     `vm-fetched-message-max' specifies this number.  (Default is 10.)

   * New variable `vm-imap-default-account' allows IMAP-FCC copies to
     be routed there.

   * New variable `vm-imap-server-timeout' allows timeout during a wait
     for output from an IMAP server.

   * New variable `vm-imap-ensure-active-sessions' asks VM to ensure
     that an IMAP session is active before issuing commands.

VM 8.1.90a  (2010-05-11)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

  ** This version contains an experimental feature of using IMAP
     folders in "headers-only" mode, with body loaded only on demand.
     This helps to keep the folder sizes small and VM to run faster.
     However, this code is in a preliminary stage.  Please use it
     with CAUTION.

     variable: vm-load-headers-only

     If set to t, all new messages will be loaded to the cache-folder
     in headers-only mode.  The body is loaded on demand when a
     message is displayed in the Presentation Buffer.  This is a
     temporary load and is lost as soon as you move to another
     message.  

     Previewing of messages interferes with headers-only operation.
     So, you should set `vm-preview-lines' to nil.

     To load the message body into the Folder Buffer, use:

     command: vm-load-message (bound to 'o')

     This command discards the current body of the message, if any,
     and refreshes it from the server copy. Some of the VM operations,
     e.g., vm-save-message, can only be performed if the body is
     loaded into the Folder Buffer. 

     command : vm-unload-message (bound to 'O')

     This command discards the current body of the message from the
     Folder Buffer and leaves it empty.

     FAILURE RECOVERY: If the cache folder gets corrupted for any
     reason, just delete it from the file system.  A new cache folder
     will be generated upon the next visit.

   * New variable `vm-imap-refer-to-inbox-by-account-name' allows IMAP
     folders named "INBOX" to be referred to by their account names
     inside VM.

   * The command `vm-fix-my-summary!!!' renamed to `vm-fix-my-summary'
     to make it easier to type.

   * The chatter of minibuffer messages during paging of mail is
     reduced: messages about MIME decoding are emitted only if the new
     variable `vm-emit-messages-for-mime-decoding' is non-nil, and
     messages about end of messages are emitted only of
     `vm-auto-next-message' is non-nil.

   * IMAP session dialogue restructured using UID queries, which makes
     VM more reliable in handling real-time changes on the server side.

   * New variable `vm-imap-connection-mode' can be set to 'offline to
     allow IMAP cache folders to be used offline.  After connecting to
     the network, do `C-u M-x vm-imap-synchronize' to force full
     synchronization. 

   * Improved error messages arising in IMAP sessions wih the server.

   * New variable `vm-do-fcc-before-mime-encode' (formerly in
     vm-rfaddons) allows you to save fcc copies of messages before
     mime-encoding them.

   * The right-mouse-button context menu for URL's in messages updated
     to eliminate obsolete web browsers.  Entries added for Firefox,
     Mozilla and Opera.

   * The function `vm-mouse-send-url-to-konqueror-new-browser' renamed
     to `vm-mouse-send-url-to-konqueror-new-window', to be consistent
     with other similar functions.

  ** New variables `vm-expunge-before-quit' and `vm-expunge-before-save'
     introduced to allow automatic expunge.  They are nil by default.  

VM 8.1.2
  
    * VM made safe for use with Gnu Emacs 23, by removing a few calls
      to the `next-line' function (which was redefined in this Emacs).

    * Several critical problems with Thunderbird inter-operability
      were corrected.  Manual section on Thunderbird folders added.

    * Extended Org mode email links to work for virtual folders.
    
  CHANGES

   ** The default values of `vm-pop-expunge-after-retrieving' and
      `vm-imap-expunge-after-retrieving' changed to nil to help new
      users.

    * `vm-fill-long-lines-in-reply' initialized to the default value
      of `fill-column'.

    * All MIME messages are now decoded in the Presentation buffer,
      unless they have US-ASCII as their charset.  In particular,
      messages with 8bit charsets are treated this way.  Such messages
      are not regarded "plain messages" any more.

VM 8.1.1 (2010-04-26)

   ** The variable vm-always-use-presentation-buffer is deprecated.
      Please remove all settings for this variable in your init file.
      The default behaviour will be to always use the presentation
      buffer.  Report any problems that might arise as a result.

    * Extended Org mode email links to handle POP and IMAP folders.
      (Use org-vm.el in the VM contrib directory until the Org mode
      distribution gets updated.)

    * Added autoloads for easy inter-operation with the Org mode.

    * Added a section on History and Administration in the info manual.

    * Made the autoloads compatible with VM 7.19 instructions.

    * Fixed the build process to treat version info better.

    * Removed a few incompatibilites with XEmacs.

    * Mode line format reverted to the original one in 7.19.  The new
      mode line format is available in the variable
      `vm-mode-line-format-robf'.  It can be installed by adding a
      vm-mode-hook. 

VM 8.1.0 (2010-03-21)

  KNOWN PROBLEMS:

    * Automatic filling is turned off for some plain text messages for
      safety reasons.  Please help us by sending us sample messages
      for which filling fails.

    * IMAP folders occasionally give spurious connection errors.
      Doing vm-get-new-mail ('g') resumes the connection.

  MAJOR NEW FEATURES:

    * Support for reading and replying to messages in HTML.

    * Full support for IMAP servers.  (See "IMPROVEMENTS for
      imap-folders" below.) 

  CHANGES:

   ** New boolean variable `vm-word-wrap-paragraphs' controls the word
      wrapping of paragraphs in messages using the longlines library.
      The variable is set to nil by default. When it is set to t,
      paragraphs are word wrapped and the value of the variable
      `vm-fill-paragraphs-containing-long-lines' is immaterial (as
      long it is non-nil).  Set vm-word-wrap-paragraphs to nil to
      enable the usual filling functionality.

   ** vm-pgg is not loaded by default because it is a set up as an
      add-on.  Users should load it from their .emacs file by using
      the sequence
           (require 'vm-autoloads)
           (require 'vm-pgg)

   ** The variable `vm-mime-show-alternatives' is deprecated.  Set
      the variable `vm-mime-alternative-select-method' to 'all to
      get the same effect.

    * Moved Robert's user-defined summary functions to the core:
     - S for human readable size
     - P for indication of attachments
     - p for indication of a postponed message

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Display number of drafts and postponed messages in the modeline
      and use a more compact modeline.  To use this feature, include
      this line in your .vm file:

        (setq vm-mode-line-format vm-mode-line-format-robf)

    * The variable `vm-paragraph-fill-column', previously removed in
      earlier versions of this release, is brought back.

   ** The commands `vm-mime-save-all-attachments' and
      `vm-mime-delete-all-attachments' have been moved to the VM core
      (from vm-rfaddons).  New variables:
	 vm-mime-deletable-types 
	    (formerly `vm-mime-delete-all-attachments-types')
	 vm-mime-deletable-type-exceptions
	    (formerly `vm-mime-delete-all-attachments-types-exceptions')
	 vm-mime-savable-types
	    (formerly `vm-mime-save-all-attachments-types')
	 vm-mime-savable-type-exceptions
	    (formerly `vm-mime-save-all-attachments-types-exceptions')         
	 vm-mime-attachment-save-directory
	 vm-mime-attachment-source-directory
	 vm-mime-all-attachments-directory
      See the info file section on MIME attachments for details.

      The options for vm-rfaddons.el should not include
      `save-all-attachments' and should be removed if it is currently
      being used.  The option `take-action-on-attachments' is not
      included by default.

    * `vm-quit-no-change' offers to delete the auto-save file if there is
      one.  (This wasn't getting done due to a bug in FSF Emacs.)

    * `vm-delete-duplicate-messages' now works by comparing message ID's.
      (from Noah Friedman's vm-addons).

    * New boolean variable `vm-sort-threads-by-youngest-date' allows
      threads to be sorted by their youngest date or oldest date.

    * `vm-yank-message' function streamlined a bit.  New variable
      `vm-include-text-from-presentation' can be used to extract the
      included message text from the presentation buffer.

   ** text/html handling controlled by a new variable
      `vm-mime-text/html-handler' which is set to 'auto-select by
      default.  It causes VM to locate the best library among
      emacs-w3m, external w3m, w3 and lynx to display html
      internally.  (This replaces the earlier variable
      `vm-mime-use-w3-for-text/html'.)

   ** vm-delete-duplicate-messages now works by comparing message ID's.
      (from Noah Friedman's vm-addons).

    * vm-yank-message function streamlined somewhat.  New variable
      `vm-include-text-from-presentation' used to extract message text
      from presentation buffer.  (This replaces the variable
      `vm-reply-include-presentation' used in vm-rfaddons.)

    * The variable `vm-mime-yank-attachments' is set to nil by default,
      so that we are not surprised by unexpectedly large mail messages.

    * The variable `vm-mime-require-mime-version-header' is set to nil
      by default, so that we will be tolerant of bad MIME senders.

    * Allow for sorting the headers of composition buffers by calling the
      function `vm-reorder-message-headers' interactively.  You may configure
      the order by the new variable `vm-mail-header-order'.  This can be
      useful if some broken MUAs (e.g. Tobit) mess up the messages due to the
      header order.

    * Added hiding and protection of headers in composition buffers.  See the
      new variable `vm-mail-mode-hidden-headers' for customization. (Thanks to
      Eric Schulte for the initial code posted in gnu.emacs.vm.info)

    * Added the function `vm-mime-list-part-structure' to list the mime part
      structure of a message.

    * Added function `vm-mime-nuke-alternative-text/html' which can be used to
      get rid of alternative text/html parts.

    * VMPC: Better action reader and a default profile which is used if no
      email addresses could be found.  The meaning of the arguments for
      `vmpc-prompt-for-profile' has been slightly simplified, see the doc
      string for details.  

    * Removed `vm-paragraph-fill-column', the value is now taken from
      `vm-fill-paragraphs-containing-long-lines' thus allowing to fill to the
      available window with.

    * Replaced `vm-fill-paragraphs-containing-long-lines' by the faster and
      more flexible version from vm-rfaddons.el.  Also cleaned up calls to the
      fill function and removed code duplication.  The code using longline.el
      remains in vm-rfaddons.el, but it must be used explicitly now in an
      advice.

    * Moved the variable `vm-fill-long-lines-in-reply-column' from
      vm-rfaddons.el to VM core.  It is not necessary to hook the fill
      function, just set the variable.

    * Errors caused by `vm-retrieved-spooled-mail-hook' are reported and
      assimilation of messages continues instead of aborting.

    * Handle filenames also from the disposition fields "name", "filename*"
      and "name*", where the latter two get decoded as they might contain 8bit
      chars.

    * Uncoupled searching of MIME images from source location.  The search
      should be a bit smarter now allowing to place the images outside of the
      source tree now.

    * Added syncing of message status when visiting a mbox of Thunderbird.
      Not all message flags are interchangeable and the message summary
      file (.msf) of Thunderbird will get removed by VM in order to force
      Thunderbird to rebuild it.  Also VMs folder index will be skipped if
      it is older than the folder in order to update VMs message status flags.

    * Improved text/html displaying by w3m.  Inline images are now extracted
      correctly and they also display now.  Added a generic handler code to
      support also other HTML handlers.

    * Added variable `vm-restore-saved-summary-formats' to restore
      each folder's summary format to what was saved previously.
      (Uday S. Reddy)

    * A prefix argument to `vm-fix-my-summary!!!' will kill a folders local
      summary format which was restored by `vm-restore-saved-summary-formats'.

    * The button for an image or PDF shows a thumbnail now when possible.
      This requires ImageMagick.  (Thanks to Eric Schulte for the idea and
      initial code.)

    * Allow to reorder messages headers before sending by setting the new
      variable `vm-mail-reorder-message-headers'.

    * Allow UTF-8 encoded messages to be displayed on tty.  (Ulrich Müller)

  BUG FIXES

    * `vm-quit-no-change' made to honour the setting of the variable
      `delete-auto-save-files'. (Uday S. Reddy)

    * Allow the use of iso-8859-1 for outgoing mail under Emacs 23
      (instead of spurious iso-2022-jp).  (Ulrich Müller)

    * Coding system set to binary when reading and writing to allow
      for 8-bit content.  (Julian Bradfield)

  IMPROVEMENTS for pop-folders (Uday S. Reddy)

    * Added the variable `vm-pop-debug' to keep trace buffers.

    * New commands `vm-pop-start-bug-report' and `vm-pop-submit-bug-report'
      which track POP session details.


  IMPROVEMENTS for imap-folders (Uday S. Reddy)

   ** New variable `vm-imap-account-alist' allows multiple IMAP
      accounts to be handled uniformly.  The variable
      `vm-imap-server-list' is now obsolete.  IMAP folders should be
      specified in the minibuffer using the account:mailbox format.
      See the info node on IMAP folders.

    * New variable `vm-load-headers-only' to enable headers-only
      downloading of IMAP folders.    (This is still experimental.)

    * IMAP-FCC is extended to work for virtual folders, but only if
      the real parent message is an IMAP message.

    * Made server expunge more robust.  Added new variable
      `vm-imap-expunge-retries' to force retries for sluggish servers.

    * Allow message attributes as well as labels to be saved on server.

    * Changed vm-imap-get-new-mail to do synchronization: reading and writing
      message attributes & labels, expunge messages in the cache.  Added
      variable `vm-imap-sync-on-get' to control this behavior.

    * Added command `vm-imap-synchronize' to do full synchronization. 

    * Trapping IMAP server errors uniformly.

    * Added variable `vm-imap-tolerant-of-bad-imap' to allow minor
      violations of the IMAP spec by IMAP servers.

    * New commands `vm-imap-start-bug-report' and `vm-imap-submit-bug-report'
      which track IMAP session details.

VM 8.0.14    2009-12-16

  BUGFIXES

    * Removed an incompatibility of the mapvector procedure with XEmacs.

VM 8.0.13    2009-11-29  

  MANAGEMENT CHANGES:

    * VM being maintained by "VM development team", vm@lists.launchpad.net,
      consisting of Robert Fenk, Uday Reddy and Ulrich Müller.

  BUGFIXES:

    * VM-Cache entries were broken by encoding the pretty printed cache string
      instead of the individual strings.  This bug was introduced in 8.0.10 by
      the bug fix for correctly storing the cached multibyte summary entries.
      It causes building of the summary to fail.  Broken cache entries are now
      detected and removed while loading a folder.

VM 8.0.12    2008-11-05

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Display version info when calling `vm-version' interactively.  (Thanks
      to Ulrich Müller)

    * Yanking of messages uses the same MIME decoding as the presentation
      now.  See the new variable `vm-mime-yank-attachments' to configure if
      attachments are also yanked.

    * `u-vm-color.el' is bundled and maintained with VM now.  Ulf Jasper handed
      it over to me as he switched to Gnus.

  BUGFIXES:

    * Detect w3 by using `locate-library' instead of checking for a bound
      `w3-about'. (Thanks to Klaus Straubinger)

    * vm.revno.el was not installed anymore b "make install".  (Thanks to
      Ulrich Müller for reporting)

    * Insert `emacs-version' instead of creating wrong version string for
      XEmacs, i.e. the patch level was the major version. (Thanks to Stephen
      Turnbull)

    * Correctly locate the data directory for the pixmaps when running as a
      XEmacs package.

    * Check for some MIME character sets that may be available in recent
      XEmacs.  (Thanks to Aidan Kehoe for the patch)

    * Some documentation fixes. (Thanks to Michael Ernst for the patches)

    * Fixed infinite loop in vm-mime-encode-words on XEmacs  21.5-b28.
      (Thanks to Aidan Kehoe for the patch)

    * Detect "score" (additionally to "hits") in "X-Spam-Status:" headers in
      `vm-su-spam-score-aux'. (Patch from Michael Ernst)

    * Typo fix in vm-pcrisis.texinfo. (Patch from Michael Ernst)

    * Header encoding was BASE64 instead of QP by default and it was not
      encoding whole words, but only the 8bit chars instead. (Thanks to Ulrich
      Müller for reporting)

    * MIME text parts interleaved by attachments are now correctly yanked,
      e.g. when replying to a message.

    * Limit the buffer-name length and sanitize the used characters. (Thanks
      to Mark Diekhans for reporting)

    * Do not fail on corrupted address headers.  (Reported by John Covici)

    * Fixed GTK detection and toolbar handling for newer Emacs 22 versions.

Public bug reported:
 
VM 8.0.11    2008-08-11

  BUGFIXES:

    * Removed dependency of vm-revno.el to other lisp sources to avoid
      building it in a release bundle.  (Thanks to Ralf Fassel)

VM 8.0.10    2008-07-22

  NOTES:

    * This is the first version of VM 8.* to be also released as a XEmacs
      package.

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Added missing documentation for `vm-user-agent', "?" binding and
      'vm-delete-duplicate-messages'.  (Thanks to Alan Wehmann)

    * `vm-message-history.el' now uses a buffer similar to the summary for
      browsing the history.  The buffer replaces the summary buffer when
      present.  Duplicate history entries will be removed.

    * Define and use `vm-replace-in-string' which is `replace-in-string'
      from XEmacs to avoid clashes with other GNU Emacs packages defining
      it differently. Unfortunately, GNU Emacs still does not provide this
      handy function. (Thanks to José Miguel Figueroa)

    * MIME encoding of header will automatically happen now and has been moved
      from `vm-rfaddons.el' to `vm-mime.el' and `vm-vars.el'.

  BUGFIXES:

    * Rewrote `vm-message-history.el' to also work for XEmacs.

    * Leading lines of a yanked message were accidently taken as headers and
      got removed if `vm-reply-include-presentation' was t.

    * Fixed encoding of headers for trailing 8 bit characters.  (Thanks to
      Lutz Euler for the patch)

    * Decode (QP-)encoded clear text before decrypting it.

    * Use nil as default for `vm-mime-8bit-composition-charset' and thus
      enable proper detection of right charset.  (Thanks to Naoki Saito for
      reporting and debugging)

    * Fixed bug in `vm-mime-display-external-generic' for GNU Emacs 23 causing
      corrupted content in the output file.  The old code has been replaced by
      a call to `vm-mime-send-body-to-file' which avoids duplication and works.
      There has been some special handling for `vm-fsfemacs-mule-p', but the
      actual reason for this was unclear so it has been removed.

    * Correctly handle `vm-enable-addons' being t.

    * Correctly store UTF-8 strings in the X-VM-v5-Data header to avoid
      corruption of summary lines. (Thanks to Yuning Feng for reporting)

    * Correctly encode multibyte subjects. (Thanks to Yuning Feng for the
      patch) 

    * Use BASE64 for header encoding when there are special chars not quoted
      by QP normally.  You may configure this by `vm-mime-encode-headers-type'.

    * qp-decode program handles premature end of QP-encoded stream now
      gracefully. (Thanks to Ralf Fassel for the bug report, fix and testing)

    * Added missing newline after "Content-Type" when using the command
      `vm-mime-attach-object-from-message'.  (Thanks to Dan Freed)

VM 8.0.9    2008-02-20

  BUGFIXES:

    * Added documentation to `vm-mime-external-content-types-alist' that no
      extra single quotes should be used around %f as the file name is already
      quoted for the shell. (Thanks to Martin Schwenke)

    * Fixed version number generation in release script.  It was broken for
      8.0.8, i.e. it was showing 8.0.x-xemacs-542 instead.  Now also other
      branch related information is stored in the file vm-revno.el.

VM 8.0.8    2008-02-11

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Reactivated "Allow defadvice on function `vm' by recursing on session
      start".  It should work correctly now.

    * Added interactive `vm-pipe-message-to-command-discard-output' and
      the non-interactive `vm-pipe-message-to-command-to-string' for using
      it in own functions.

    * Added `vm-pipe-messages-to-command*' for bulk piping messages to a
      single command, i.e. like saving to a pipe.  This is substantially
      faster than `vm-pipe-message-to-command*' which call the command on 
      each message separately.  You may want to use it to feed spamassasin.

    * Modified key bindings for piping messages, i.e. "|" is a prefix key
      now. Type it twice to get the old pipe command, "|d" will call the 
      discard the output, just display some infos in the mode line. "|s" 
      will call `vm-pipe-messages-to-command' and "|n" will also call it 
      but discard the output.

    * Removed vm-easymenu.el and use easymenu.el instead.

    * In `vm-save-message-preview', ask the user if the output file already
      exists instead of silently overwriting it.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Moved [Undo] to Dispose menu and [Emacs] to Help menu as these do not
      work in Emacs 22 anymore when on the menu bar.

    * Fixed intermixing of signature and quoted text in reply if
      `vm-reply-include-presentation' is t. (Thanks to Roland Winkler for
      debugging and reporting)

    * Fixed yanking of presentation from wrong folder when folder is virtual.
      (Thanks to Roland Winkler for reporting)

    * Redistributed flag not displayed in presentation buffer mode line. 
      https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=428248 (Thanks to Jonathan
      Underwood for the fix)

    * `vm-submit-bug-report' gets the variables dynamically now and thus does
      not miss new ones or references old ones anymore. 

    * Correctly determine the real folder when postponing compositions started
      from a virtual folder. (Thanks to Uday S. Reddy for reporting and 
      debugging)

    * Avoid crash when `vm-mouse-set-mouse-track-highlight' is not called
      within a summary buffer or without a valid message pointer.

    * Do not disable modes which do not exist. (Thanks to Uday S. Reddy for
      reporting) 

    * Set correct coding-system-for-read for the real messages of
      virtual folders.  (Thanks to Julian Bradfield)

VM 8.0.7    2008-01-05

  BUG FIXES:

    * Disable only those minor modes listed in the variable
      `vm-disable-modes-before-encoding' before encoding a
      composition. (Thanks to Alley for reporting and debugging)

    * Removed recursion from function `vm' added by 8.0.6, as it 
      causes startup troubles.

    * Removed extra newline before attachment buttons. (Thanks to Alley for
      reporting)

    * Removed wrongly used calls to `interactive-p'. (Thanks to Alley for
      reporting and debugging)

VM 8.0.6    2008-01-02

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Rewrote INSTALL to be more consistent and more understandable.

    * Allow defadvice on function `vm' by recursing on session start. (Thanks
      to Blueman for the code)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Ignore empty reply-to in `vm-ignored-reply-to'.

    * Quoted the variable `vm-summary-format' in a doc string.

    * Fixed typos in the docstring of `vm-mail-send-and-exit'.

    * Disable all minor modes before encoding a composition.  This results in
      faster encoding when font-lock was enabled and avoids problems when
      parts of a MIME object button get expanded due to an abbrev and thus the
      extent/overlay gets split into two separate parts causing an encoding
      error.

    * Avoid duplicate mime buttons during decoding. (Thanks to Alley for
      reporting)

    * Mask 8 bit chars by 0xff in `vm-mime-qp-encode-region' to avoid crash
      for those with all higher order bits set (negative ones?) (Thanks to
      Blueman for the fix.)

VM 8.0.5    2007-11-03

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fixed bug caused by fixing `vm-drop-buffer-name-chars' in 8.0.4.  There
      is a 20-40% chance to create a new bug when fixing one.  Regression
      tests would be nice, but we do not have any for VM ;-/

VM 8.0.4    2007-11-02

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Require cl.el at compile-time only. (Thanks to John J. Foerch)

    * Quiet compiler warning about old style backquotes. (Thanks to John
      J. Foerch)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Correctly call custom-add-load. (Thanks to John J. Foerch and
      Jonathan.underwood) 

    * Fixed building of vm-cus-load.el for Emacs 21.

    * Use the old default for `vm-primary-inbox', i.e. "~/INBOX".

    * Honor a t in `vm-drop-buffer-name-chars' as documented.

VM 8.0.3    2007-08-15

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Unified `vm-continue-what-message', i.e. first check for composition
      buffers, if none exist then for saved drafts.  Also added new variable
      `vm-zero-drafts-start-compose'.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fixed building of autoloads for GNU Emacs.

    * Docfixes for vm-pine.el (Thanks to Stephen Eglen).

    * Resurrected `vm-add-reply-subject-prefix' which was lost by the commit
      of revno 91.

    * Search for BZR only if bzrdir exists and use locate-file only when
      defined.

    * Use  vm-mime-8bit-composition-charset as a fallback also for MULE Emacs.

    * Fixed defcustom of vm-keep-crash-boxes and vm-spool-files.

    * Fixed the section headers of the NEWS file.

VM 8.0.2    2007-07-25

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Added --with-pixmapdir to configure the location of the pixmaps.

    * DESTDIR-Patch (Ulrich Müller).

  BUG FIXES:

    * Avoid overflow of `buffer-undo-list' when inserting or encoding
      big attachments.

    * defcustom of `vm-mime-all-attachments-directory' should list nil.

    * Honor pre VM 8.0.0 values of `vm-folder-directory' and
      `vm-primary-inbox'. This should eliminate problems with users which
      never changed the defaults. 

    * Use "cygwin-mount" to fix paths when available.

    * Activate summary faces only when requested by vm-enable-addons.

    * Fixed defcustom of `vm-enable-addons' and added documentation.

    * "make install" creates $(bindir) now.

    * Separate paths (e.g. otherdirs) only by semicolons to avoid problems on
      Win32.

    * Handle paths with spaces correctly.

    * Install also pixmaps for GTK enabled Emacs.

    * Just use the first subject when replying/forwarding to a set of
      messages.  This avoids long filenames for saved composition buffers.
    
    * Ensure we are compiling with an emacs version >= 21.

    * Encode headers regexp and case-fold-search corrected. (Ulrich Müller)

    * vm-summary-faces-mode does not leak extents anymore.

VM 8.0.1    2007-06-29

  NOTES:

    In order to get more features from vm-rfaddons set the variable
    `vm-enable-addons' in your ~/.vm.

  BUG FIXES:

    * A saner default for vm-shrunken-header-face.

    * Added documentation on vm-shrunken-headers-face and
      vm-shrunken-headers-keymap.

    * Added a new custom group `vm-faces' for faces.

    * Added autoload token for vm-user-agent.

    * Use INSTALL_PROGRAM instead of INSTALL_DATA for programs.

    * Do not set vm-folder-directory if there is ~/INBOX.  If VM does not get
      mail after upgrading from 7.19 it is probably due to the new default for
      vm-folder-directory, which was nil before.

    * Revised the bindings and enabled features to a hopefully less
      controversial setting. 

VM 8.0.0    2007-05-31

    | Yes.  Obviously I've moved on, though I've been slow to admit it
    | to myself.  Good luck.
    `--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	   
    * My (robf) VM extensions are now activated by default, where it makes
      sense to me.

    * Releases are numbered now MAJOR.MINOR.PATCHLEVEL, where MAJOR is
      increased when fundamental changes occur, MINOR for new features and
      PATCHLEVEL for bugfix releases.

    * New cleaner source tree layout.

    * Better built system based on configure.  Autoloads are generated only
      for those functions marked with the autoload token now, which are mainly
      interactive function. Thus, loading occurs only on demand and startup
      should be faster.
      
  BUG FIXES:

    * All bugs reported to gnu.emacs.vm.bugs, gnu.emacs.vm.info and directly
      to me are fixed either by the patches posted by others or me.

    * If there are any missing autoloads, please report them and add a
      (require 'vm-SOURCE) to your ~/.vm!

    * Probably added numerous new bugs.


  IMPROVEMENTS: compared to 7.19 (not vmrf)

    * A new icon set based on vm-small-pixmaps.tgz which was floating around.
      This one should fit by height to the one used in XEmacs and Emacs 22,
      but it is slightly larger than those used in Emacs 21.  If you see the
      old icons, the please set the variables `vm-image-directory' and
      `vm-toolbar-pixmap-directory' to nil in your ~/.vm!

    * vm-mime-type-converter-alist now also works when replying to messages,
      i.e. for text/html one can use lynx or w3m for the conversion.
      (setq vm-mime-type-converter-alist
	'(("text/html" "text/plain" "lynx -force_html -dump /dev/stdin")))

    * Postponing (draft handling) of compositions and continuing of drafts, in
      fact any messages also those from other people. (Info node: Sending
      Messages) 

    * New mail header insertion functions for return-receipts, mail-priority
      and FCC.

    * More virtual folder selectors and replacements of other functions based
      on selectors. (Info node: Virtual Folders)

    * vm-serial.el provides message templates for composition and
      personalizes mass emails. (Info node: TODO)
    
    * vm-biff.el for popups with a list of new messages.

    * vm-rfaddons.el has various stuff, look at the source if you are curious
      or miss some VM feature, as it might already be there!
